# Seller-Assistant – System Architecture  

This document describes the planned technical architecture of **Seller-Assistant**. It helps contributors and developers understand how the system is structured and how components interact.  

---

## 🏗️ High-Level Overview
Seller-Assistant will be developed as a **mobile-first web application** with optional native wrappers for iOS/Android.  
Key components include:  
- **Frontend (Mobile/Web UI)**  
- **Backend API (Business Logic & Authentication)**  
- **Database (Persistent Storage)**  
- **Integrations (3rd party services, payments, analytics)**  

---

## 📱 Frontend
- **Framework**: React Native (for mobile apps) and React.js/Next.js (for web).  
- **UI Toolkit**: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for fast, consistent design.  
- **Responsibilities**:  
  - User onboarding & authentication  
  - Dashboard for sales agents  
  - Marketplace interface (browse, order, track)  
  - Training modules (micro-courses, video, quizzes)  
  - Notifications & reminders  

---

## ⚙️ Backend (API & Logic)
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js or NestJS  
- **Authentication**: JWT + OAuth2 (Google/Facebook login optional)  
- **Responsibilities**:  
  - User & role management (agents, producers, cooks, store employees)  
  - Commission tracking & payouts  
  - Product catalog management (microgreens, other local products)  
  - Order processing & payment handling  
  - Analytics (sales, performance dashboards)  
  - Training content delivery  

---

## 🗄️ Database
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (scalable relational database).  
- **Optional Search Layer**: ElasticSearch (for product and customer search).  
- **Schema Overview**:  
  - `Users` (agents, producers, cooks, store employees, admins)  
  - `Products` (microgreens, vegetables, herbs, etc.)  
  - `Orders` (status, payments, commissions)  
  - `TrainingModules` (lessons, quizzes, progress tracking)  
  - `Analytics` (KPIs, sales performance, growth metrics)  

---

## 🌍 Integrations
- **Payments**: Stripe / PayPal for global, Viva Wallet for EU.  
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (push) + email (SendGrid).  
- **Analytics**: Mixpanel or Google Analytics for usage metrics.  
- **Geolocation**: Google Maps API for store/producer proximity.  

---

## 🔐 Security
- Role-based access control (RBAC).  
- Encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).  
- Secure storage of sensitive data (hashed passwords, no plain-text secrets).  
- Regular audits following the SECURITY.md guidelines.  

---

## 🚀 Deployment
- **Hosting**:  
  - Frontend: Vercel / Netlify  
  - Backend: AWS / DigitalOcean / Heroku  
  - Database: AWS RDS / Supabase  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing, builds, and deployments.  

---

## 🔄 Scalability Plan
- Year 1–2: Monolithic backend (simpler, cheaper).  
- Year 3–5: Transition to microservices (scalable per feature).  
- Use containerization (Docker + Kubernetes) for production scaling.  

---

## 📌 Summary
The architecture balances **simplicity** (easy for small teams) with **scalability** (ready for growth in 5+ years). It allows Seller-Assistant to start lean (grant-funded MVP) and expand into a global SaaS platform.
